# UCTtoCNN_OpenAI

This is the code of the imitation learning algorithm that train the network using data generated by the UCT method (repo [atari_uct_cluster](https://github.com/Net-Mist/atari_uct_cluster)).

The python script to train the network is cnn_atari_train.py and the script to test it and to see the network playing the game is cnn_atari.py
